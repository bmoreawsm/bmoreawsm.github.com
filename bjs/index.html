  <p>Welcome to B'more Awesome's Beginning Javascript class</p>
  <a class='btn btn-primary btn-large' href="/ihc/1-button-link.html">Get Started &raquo;</a>
</div>

<h2>Pre-requisites</h2>
<p>Before starting the lessons, please do the following:</p>

<h3>Sublime Text</h3>
<p>There are many text editors available, from free to expensive and from simple to complex. I've chosen <a href="http://www.sublimetext.com/">Sublime Text</a> for this class as it is simple, but offers many features if you want to dig down into them.</p>
<p>If you already have an editor you like, please use it. As long as you can easily edit raw HTML, CSS and Javascript.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.sublimetext.com" class='btn btn-primary'>Download Sublime Text &raquo;</a></p>

<h3>Google Chrome</h3>
<p>Google Chrome has a built-in html and css inspector which we will use during the course.</p>
<p>If you have firefox with firebug, that works too. So does Safari. Just not IE :-).</p>
<p><a href="http://google.com/chrome" class='btn btn-primary'>Download Google Chrome &raquo;</a></p>
