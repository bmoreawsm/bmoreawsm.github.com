<h2>Pre-requisites</h2>
<p>Before starting the lessons, please do the following:</p>

<h3>Install a text editor</h3>
<p>There are many available, from free to expensive. I've chosen <a href="http://www.sublimetext.com/">Sublime Text</a> for this class as it is simple, but offers many features if you want to dig down into them.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.sublimetext.com" class='btn btn-primary'>Download Sublime Text &raquo;</a></p>

<h3>Install Dropbox</h3>
<p>Dropbox has a public folder feature which we will use to host our html files.</p>
<p><a href="http://db.tt/Iui1dk7w" class='btn btn-primary'>Sign up and install Dropbox</a></p>
