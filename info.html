<h2 class='alpha'>What?</h2>
<p>The first B'more Awesome event will be a one-day class on HTML &amp; CSS. We're going to start from the very beginning, so if you've never made a web site before, that's ok! It's going to be a guided hands-on workshop where <a href="http://ngauthier.com">Nick Gauthier</a> will take you through building a web site with modern techniques. By the end of the class, you'll have built a site on the real-live internet.</p>
<p>(If you're looking for something more advanced, stay tuned, we'll have more courses soon!)</p>
<p>Here is the full day's schedule:</p>
<ul>
  <li>9:30: Introductions</li>
  <li>10:00: Students will make a basic html file on their computer and view it in their browser</li>
  <li>11:00: Students will upgrade their web page using the core html tags</li>
  <li>12:00: Students will put their html page in a Dropbox public folder and view it on the web</li>
  <li>1:00: Break for lunch (brown bag or a local take-out place)</li>
  <li>2:00: Students will add a simple css stylesheet to their html page</li>
  <li>3:00: Students will add more complex css styles to their page</li>
  <li>4:00: Demo of more advanced html/css with links to resources to learn more</li>
  <li>4:30: All done! We'll hang out until 5 and chat and answer more questions, or work on our page more</li>
</ul>
<p>This class will be hands-on, so bring your laptop! Also, please install <a href="http://dropbox.com">Dropbox</a> so we can use their public folders to host our site.</p>
