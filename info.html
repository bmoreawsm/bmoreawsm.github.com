<h2 class='alpha'>What?</h2>
<p>The first B'more Awesome event will be a one-day class on HTML &amp; CSS. We're going to start from the very beginning, so if you've never made a web site before, that's ok! It's going to be a guided hands-on workshop where <a href="http://ngauthier.com">Nick Gauthier</a> will take you through building a web site with modern techniques. By the end of the class, you'll have built a site on the real-live internet.</p>
<p>(If you're looking for something more advanced, stay tuned, we'll have more courses soon!)</p>
